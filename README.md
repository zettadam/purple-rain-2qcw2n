# FIREFLY.ENTOURAGE-II

This assesment is designed to test your proficiency in frontend development using React with Typescript. Please use Typescript for all components and functionalities. Please ensure there are no lint errors or warnings. It should take under an hour to complete this assessment. We are interested in seeing how you implement these tasks; the use (or non-use) of libraries to complete these tasks is up to you.

This skeleton project is built with vite and uses scss modules for styling. Modify any styles as needed to ensure proper functionality of the implemented component. With that said, keep in mind that this is not an assessment of design skills (we have a team for that), so don't go beyond necessary basics.

## Tasks

1. **Component development:** Implement a Todo component:
   - [x] Retrieve a list of todos from mock api at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
   - [x] Render a list of todo item names
   - [x] Apply styles to make the list visually appealing
2. **Manage State:** Enhance the Todo component by implementing todo item selection and detailed todo view:
   - [x] Implement a method to select a todo item in the list implemented in the previous step
   - [x] Implement a method to display the selected todo item details
   - [x] Create styling which provides feedback to the user when an item is selected/deselected
3. **Unit Testing:** Install a testing library of your choice and implement tests to cover the following scenarios:
   - [x] Verify that the todos are fetched and displayed
   - [x] Ensure that clicking on a todo updates the detail view implemented in the previous step.
